                <h3>#1 LEMMiNO</h3>
                    <p>LEMMiNO is a Youtuber who mostly uploads videos about unsolved mysteries. Some of their most popular videos cover topics such as Cicada 3301, UFOs, and Jack the Ripper. My personal favorite video is about the various theories surrounding D.B. Cooper. A man who hijacked a Boeing 727 by claiming he had a bomb in his briefcase. He demanded a $200,000 ransom in exchange for the passengers of the plane, then escaped using a parachute, earning him a spot on the FBI's most wanted list. Uncover the main suspects behind the legend in "The Search For D. B. Cooper"</p>

                <h3>#2 Nexpo</h3>
                    <p>Nexpo is a Youtuber who's content revolves around horror, covering both fiction and nonfiction stories. The channel description reads, "Exploring the Internet's dark side." Some of the most popular videos cover stalkers, cults, and unsolved mysteries. My favorite video is about Elan School; a boarding school located in Maine that is a part of the troubled teens industry. The school claims to be therapeutic, rehabilitating people with learning disabilities, emotional regulation, mental illness, and even substance abuse. However, the school's unconventional practices are questioned when it's uncovered that there has been a series of incidents including injuries, missing students, and deaths. Beware, as the truth may shock and disturb you in "The Cult in a Boarding School"</p>

                <h3>#3 tanman5123</h3>
                    <p>tanman5123 is a Youtuber who primarily creates content about history and mysteries. Their videos usually cover "icebergs"; charts that are a large image of an iceberg with text overlaid that place various topics in order from most well-known to most obscure from top to bottom. This is inspired by the saying, "It's only the tip of the iceberg." Some of their most popular videos cover icebergs about WW1, WW2, and Historic Lost Media. My favorite video is about the Vietnam War. This covers events that are documented and verified by multiple sources as well as unsolved mysteries and urban legends surrounding the war. What was the incident that got the US involved? Is it true that there's a massive 100ft snake somewhere in the jungles of Vienam? And who is Hanoi Hannah? Discover all of this and more in "Mysteries and Obscurities of The Vietnam War Iceberg"</p>
